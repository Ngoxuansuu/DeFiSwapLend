# DeFiSwapLend

A DeFi application for token swapping, lending, and liquidity pools. This is an open-source project built with Solidity and Hardhat, deployed on the Sepolia testnet.

## Overview

`DeFiSwapLend` is a decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contract that enables:
- **Token Swapping**: Swap tokens with a simplified 1:1 ratio (for demo purposes).
- **Lending**: Borrow and repay tokens with a fixed 5% interest rate.
- **Liquidity Pools**: Add liquidity to pools to support swapping and lending.

The project is designed to be open-source, publicly available on GitHub, and compatible with the **Tea Protocol** for OSS incentivization.
